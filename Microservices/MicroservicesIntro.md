# Microservice :

```
Microservices-based architecture is aligned with Event-driven Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, where complex applications are composed of small independent processes which communicate with each other through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) over a network. APIs allow access by other internal services of the same application or external, third-party services and applications.
